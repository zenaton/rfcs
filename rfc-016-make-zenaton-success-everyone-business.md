# Make Zenaton success is everyone's concern

## Summary

Zenaton success MUST be everyone's concern. This RFC discusses how makes it happen.

## Problem

No one SHOULD think he is not concerned by Zenaton success.
In particular the tech team SHOULD avoid to focus on technical stuff only.

It's important to understand that - at short term - those tasks will have a bigger impact on Zenaton than eg. adding more features.

## Proposal

- Everyone MUST write at least 1 blog post per month - just doing that will allow us to publish 2+ articles per week, which is great for inbound marketing :)
- Everyone MUST dedicate 2 half-day per week to help. There are many ways to contribute:
    - evangelise friends / Quora / StackOverflow...
    - support customer (you will need an access to [Crisp](https://crisp.chat))
    - write contents (blog posts, improve documentation..., you will need to be added to [our Medium publication](https://medium.com/zenaton))
    - help sales (sourcing new customers, nurturing existing lists...)  (we SHOULD find an alternative to Pipedrive)

    *This work MUST be included in daily written standup*.
